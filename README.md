# RLWE-HDL-Secure
Open-source HDL implementation of RLWE for quantum-resistant encryption.

## Introduction
Welcome to RLWE-HDL-Secure, an open-source Hardware Description Language (HDL) implementation of the Ring Learning with Errors (RLWE) algorithm. This project aims to provide a robust framework for quantum-resistant encryption, promoting security innovations in the era of quantum computing.

## Background
Ring Learning with Errors (RLWE) is a foundational problem in lattice-based cryptography that forms the basis for constructing various cryptographic primitives that are believed to be secure against quantum attacks. This repository focuses on implementing RLWE using HDL to facilitate simulations and real-world applications in secure communications.

## Project Goals
- **Develop**: Create a reliable and efficient HDL model of RLWE.
- **Educate**: Serve as an educational tool for those interested in quantum-resistant cryptography.
- **Innovate**: Provide a basis for further research and development in hardware-based cryptographic solutions.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
- VHDL or Verilog simulator (e.g., Xilinx Vivado, ModelSim)
- Basic understanding of cryptography and HDL

### Installation
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RLWE-HDL-Secure.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd RLWE-HDL-Secure
   ```
3. Compile the HDL source files (example command):
   ```bash
   ghdl -a rlwe_module.vhdl

## Usage
Describe how to run the simulations/tests for your system. Provide code examples if possible.

### Running Simulations
```bash
# Example command to run a simulation
ghdl -r rlwe_testbench
```
